# Cesar-cipher-cracker-Ui

The main function of the code is to provide an easy and interactive way for users to code and decode messages through the use of the Cesar Cipher (or shift cipher) although its more advanced capability resides in being able to "crack" any coded sample into plain English.

This secondary, but more interesting, capability is made possible through an analysis of the letter frequency within the input coded sample. 26 possible variations on the key (or offset) are scored against the common English letter frequency and the lowest score obtained through "mean square difference" is the algorythm's best guess. 

Further support for and translation into Spanish and Portuguese will be inplemented in future updates
